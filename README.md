# What is Specify

Specify provides the first Design API allowing you to send your design tokens and assets across your design system tools. Specify is built with this idea: configure once, synchronize anytime.

Specify is composed of:

* a database—to store [your design tokens and assets](usage/token-types.md)
* a design API—to synchronize your design tokens and assets within your design system
* a list of open source [parsers](usage/parsers.md)—to transform your design tokens and assets
